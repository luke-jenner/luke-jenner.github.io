Lost City of Lafhaeor - "Running Water" - name given by Ellesionese settlers in the late 1st age. **Center of Kawluurac's massive river basin.**
...eventually referred to as **Lanorn** - Dead Water

TL;DR
- Predates Flying Cities, Primal Peoples - "barbaric"
- Second age, Divine Folk "found Betrayer remanants" and war broke out
- Rage of Dragons ~1,000 years ago, became a lair to a conclave of chromatics
- Lich lair afterward, became a necropolis - renamed Lanorn - heroes stopped the lich
- Now a "don't go there" spot

When elves were settling what is currently [[Veldexian Reach]] in Velde Aerdrie after the Fall of Flying Cities, this city was already there. Written as magical, though far older and "barbaric" compared to the flying cities. Primal peoples. 

Eventually, during the second age, divine folk of Velde Aerdrie grew uncomfortable and maybe even curious of the foreign magicks Lafhaeor dealt with. Emissaries were sent to “build a bridge” between the two cultures, as the history books wrote it. Though it only took a few miscommunications between the two until war broke out. Depending on the stories, it could have been divine paladins of the Prime Deities routing out Betrayer remnants influence lasting from the Godswar. But the more truth that came out about it, Velde Aerdrie is now commonly regarded as the unfair aggressor, regardless of how much presence the Betrayer Gods had. The divine branch of [[Adriziq Ojo]] has in recent centuries attempted repartition efforts. Though they haven’t exactly been a cleansing force for all the power hungry entities that were drawn to Lafhaeor. 

After the Rage of Dragons subsided about 1,000 years ago, it became lair to a bitter, power-hoarding conclave of chromatics. 

For a period of time afterward, a lich ruled the forgotten city and it became a Necropolis - reaping off the damages from the war between Lafhaeor and Velde Aerdrie. It was during the lich's rule the city was referred to as Lanorn. It took a band of heroes out of Adriziq Ojo to unfurl the plots of the lich and depose it. Though the stains of Lanorn never fully left. 

Since, it became a perilous place many teach their children to avoid - if they teach about it at all. Many an adventurer delve to seek riches or lost artifacts, others have made it bandit guild strongholds that have come and gone. The last 200 or so years you hear stories of power coalescing there that Adriziq Ojo keeps tabs on. You're likely to find errant Shadowcrossings, or temporary bases of aberrations. Thieves guilds. Standard Faire. 

> Worshipped Tethys - after uncovering of temples to tethys during the Skilaic Period, many artifacts made their way south the river waters of Kawluurac, finding the home that Tethys had escaped to from the Crystal Peaks during the Dawnwar until she was sealed
