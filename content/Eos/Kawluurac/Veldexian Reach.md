[[Kawluurac]]
### Velde Aerdie (Blade Winds)

- Diverse metropolis, ancient indigenous city turned elven by Ellesionese conquerors in the Second Age 
- Geographically protected by surrounding hills, built above the intersection of two major rivers, enormous sweeping bridges - constant winds in open air structures
- A refuge for many during the War with Willow, now a flourishing city - the heart of all merchant exchange across Kawluraac
- Political power oversees & protects many settlements throughout the Veldexcia Reach - a built up mercantile alliance strengthened by uniting forces during the Age of Demons
- A diversely religious city, home to many fleeing Thayan prosecution though also the trading site of many dark, divine, or arcane artifacts found in the Ssarlonian Jungles to the northeast or the Kawluurac Rainforests to the southwest
- While thoroughly diverse now in the Third Age, the architecture built over indigenous Kawluraac infrastructure is just one sign of lasting colonial elven bias in the city.
- Home to [[Adriziq Ojo]], one of the largest magical academies in Kawluurac, essentially a giant magical charter school lol

A city of striking contrats - both visually and culturally. 

The city is dominated by massive, ancient bridges that connect its various districts, towering high over teh rivers below. These bridges, some wide enough to house entire districts on their surface, sweep across the city like colossal arteries, their elegant arches casting long shadows over the valleys. Open-air terraces and courtyards stretch along these elevated pathways, allowing the wind to sweep freely through the city - a constant feature of life in Velde Aerdrie. 

The architecture is a blend of ancient indigineous craftsmanship and elven stonework. Towering spires and obelisks of marble rise beside older, sturdier buildings carved from the stone of the surrounding hills. The indigenous structures are more earthbound, heavy with sacred symbolism, while the newer elven additions reach skyward. Everywhere, wind and water are motifs - whether in the flowing banners of silk that flutter in the constant breeze, or in the winding designs etched into the stone facades of the buildings. 

All throughout the city, pulled up by advanced hydraulics combined with stone pulley elevators, are dazzling waterfalls - themselves glittering alive with ether coursing through them.
