[[Mrost Region]]
**1,000 - Dragonborn, Tieflings, Drow, & Halflings**

Where the Sunset Mountains begin to shift into the Graypeaks, the rocks shift to a gleaming black slate that gives the plateau area an unusually warm climate in the sun, keeping its scattered lakes green and lively year-round. The hills in the area are dotted with mine entrances and old abandoned outposts, perfect for all manner of wildlife, dangers, and hideaway folk. 

The settlement itself extends on the plateau backing up to a rise in mountains along a lake (colloquially referred to as the Umbran Lake), Surrounding the far end of the lake and into the mountains, cutting between the Sunset and the Graypeaks, is an expanse of forest known as the Twilit Grove. It’s trees are an intimidatingly tall, dense canopy in places, further providing shade in areas during the sun, while darkening the area at night. The trees themselves were once used as a timberland in ages past when the Gray Road was a trade route, though local legends tell of the forest’s own rebelling against its destruction. <br> 
	Many halflings still say the rebellion was an alliance between them and the trees. <br> 
	Drow and Halflings lived in peace together, many Twilit Halflings still call this grove home. Hidden away is a small halfing, drow, & dark gnome village,  Vesper, though you need a guide to find it or to turn yourself upside down just as the sun sets. <br> 
	**Vesper** - Kakariko Village with more water (waterfall, cliffs, ponds) and more blues, purples, yellows for lighting. Plank bridges, stone walkways, floating goblues of yellow, flickering light. Buildings of natural materials, built from and around the rock and trees themselves. Clusters of buildings on cliff facades with winding paths that lead up, all look down on the main valley square. 
	Personalized music, blended

The town is rather small, likely no more than 1,000 residents total, though its roads and outbuildings extend into the mountains and indicate an extended segment of the settlement. The architecture, is, druidic. Thinking very Frank Lloyd Wright as the buildings themselves respond to their surroundings - many are seen to use the rocks and mountain facades as natural walls, much of the walkways is unpaved, though still flat on the black slate. Some taller structures reach up and around trees, literally building themselves around their environment while giving the natural bits some space to grow. At the far end of the Umbran Lake, a large waterfall cascades with a large, more Willowan-designed structure that seems to float atop of it. <br> 
	Building, now referred to as **The Eventide**, was constructed during Sylithian War and used as a Willowan outpost, though as since been abandoned by Willowan forces and repurposed by the Umbran locales as a meeting space between the dragonborn enclaves, the drow covens, and tiefling circles. 

Community of mostly Dragonborn & Tieflings, drow in the hills. Many displaced from Willowrun or Willengate with building of reactor, weren’t socially accepted in cities. Because of their lives of discomfort and tension in the city, they left for further communities that are not serviced by Magaron’s rails, and hence have lost trade, commerce, and welfare. Take care of themselves, though impoverished and being further unhelped by the kingdom.
