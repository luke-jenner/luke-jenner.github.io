[[Mrost Region]]
Human & dwarven port city turned military stronghold during Sylith war. ~30,000.
Candlekeep - Towered, Library fortress looking over the sea. 
Hosttower of the Arcane<br> 
	City of Sails, spans Rekyr’s River, taking river-trade from the Umberlee Sea down to Willow. 

Mrosthad rests atop immense escarpments on either side, graystone bluffs rising above the water. Around the city’s perimeter, thick stone walls with squat towers provide defense. Its southern gate, called the Twin Teeth, boasts the most impressive towers, standing twice as tall as the city walls, and bedeckted with arrow slits enough for numerous defenders, in a show of strength. 

### Ships & Five High Captains

Mrosthad is ruled by its Ships and their Five High Captains:
- First High Captain Beniago Kurth
- Second High Captain Barria Barram
- Third High Captain Dagmaer Suljack
- Fourth High Captain Throa Taerl
- Fifth High Captain Hartouchen Rethnor

Ships described by outsiders as a band of pirates, though that profiling misses how deeply ingrained the Ships are to Mrosthad and the mentality of its citizens. 
High Captains take the names of their ships when they ascend to leadership - the highest authorities of Mrosthad; conduct themselves as nobility though it isn’t hereditary.
(Each ship is not a single vessel, despite the name. Organizations owing allegiance to their captain, whom they elect for life.)
Being a member of a Ship is a privilege, ~1/10 Mrosthad citizens obtain. To join, must be fighting age, possess weapons. Limited spots, Ships don’t expand their ranks.
