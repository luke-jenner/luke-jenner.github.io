The most populous city-state of Ellesion, with cultural values of learning, magic, and progress dating back to the First Age. Home to progressive thinkers, devote thaumaturges, and wise oracles. With values of [human]ism, societal betterment, and reinvention over stagnation and totalitarianism, Altrinios is a bastion of the mortal races of the west. 

For centuries after The Fall of the Flying Cities in the First Age, the region around Altrinios was dominated by Heraklos, a tyrannical survivor of The Fall that built legions of followers from refugees through his show of arcane force. He aggressively expanded his empire, spreading it into the forests of the west and the mountains to the north. Ultimately, a band of heroes overthrew the tyrant and from the empire’s ruins rose Altrinios, a land that endeavors to reject oppression throughout the world and guards against hypocrisy within its own borders. 
  
For a time, that band of heroes divided ruling power and structure amidst a broader council, which in turn became a philosopher-led republic known as The Seven. Spearheaded by the speaker role of the First Citizen, The Seven continuously seek consul of their people and see positions overturned through vote every seven years, one representative per year. The Seven are asked to govern by philosophical principles of justice and social order, striving to uphold the highest ideals in their decisions. However, throughout history, they are not without realism and the precarious woes of deep corruption.

### Architecture & Features
Built on a complex of acropoli, the city-state’s heart rises high above the shoreline in a series of green, vibrant plateaus and cliff facades. The architectural and academic marvels of Altrinios testify to the achievements of civilized people. The streets are paved with bricks made in interlocking geometric shapes, meant to demonstrate principles of both mathematics and magic. Grand temples line the streets, testifying to the Alrinioan’s devotion to the gods. These rise as both mighty bastions dedicated to individual deities and various neighborhood shrines devoted to greater pantheons. 

Inside the city, the wild lands feel like a remote threat. Perils from the sea present more obvious dangers, but a great sea wall protects the city-state’s port. 

Altrinios features a complex web of arcane trains - some that traverse the city, others that connect the city with its surrounding settlements for trade & agriculture 
### Trade & Commerce
Export fabric & fish northward, import stonework. Altrinioans have reputations for being accomplished weavers, skilled sailors, and cunning merchants. Books and literacy are common throughout the land, and the work of scribes, cartographers, musicians, and storytellers is well regarded. The people of Altrinios believe themselves to be the inheritors of a heroic tradition, and each person owes it to themselves and to society to strive for greatness. 
### Schools of Philosophy
Altrinios holds pursuits of knowledge and wisdom at the highest ideal, and thus funds its schools and educational infrastructure above all other political endeavors. While many of the schools’ renown philosophers come from privileged classes of the city-state, the academies are funded by many stipends for academic pursuit. Different philosophical schools hold political as well as intellectual power in the city-state, with five major schools dominating Altrinioan discourse.
>**Solathfaer Corazon Institute** - Histories
**Sondeleon** - Practical, Military, and Experimental Arcana
**Sharr Shantar** - Environmental, Primal, & Druidic Arts

### Thaumaturges
Altrinioans view magic as one of the greatest art forms, and they call the most accomplished mages thaumaturges (“wonder workers”). Many Altrinioan mages are trained at the elite academy of Sondeleon, but countless smaller schools and private tutors teach the magical arts. These lessons in magic typically include a well-rounded education in the sciences and philosophy. Some thaumaturges find their magical studies aligning with popular Altrinioan philosophies and choose the schools of magic they focus on based on teachings. 
### The Army of Azuth
The military forces of Altrinios practice battlefield tactics in an environment saturated with religious devotion to Azuth, the God of Wizardry. Often referred to as the Magistrati, the military force is clever and resourceful, believing their affinity to the ambitions of The First Magister fuels them with the drive for divinity. Their extensive training in combative arcane tactics give them an edge over other soldiers, bringing them countless victories when odds were stacked against them. Their continuous underdog victories against tyranny drive the values of [mortalism] in the Altrinioan people.

### Surroundings of Altrinios
Sitting on a bordering coast of the Cerulean Sea and a broader opening to the Starfallen Sea, as well as surrounded by rivers, sparse woodlands, and vast, stepped grasslands, Altrinios is endpoint of many well-trod roads throughout the eastern coasts of Ellesion. The lands include numerous smaller settlements and wildernesses, the people who live in these holdings also seen as Altrinioan - they share the values of other inhabitants of the city-state, even if their lifestyle affords them little opportunity to study magic and philosophy.
