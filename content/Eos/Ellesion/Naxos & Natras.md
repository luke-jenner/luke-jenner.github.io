The Lovers
[[Ellesion]]
**An archipelago - connected to the Ellesion mainland deep beneath the surface, in myth is said to have been created when [[Thassa]]-Istishia wept over the acts of destruction of her first children, Umberlee and Talos. In her distress, Thessa-Istishia formed the two islands that would display all that was beautiful of her realms, and in turn gave birth to the deity of beauty, Sune.

Sune’s history is then mostly told through her various romances and flirtations with other gods - tales exist of her relationships with practically every god except Talos, Umberlee, Tempus, and Kord, whom Sune abhorred for their acts of destruction. 

Naxos and Natras truly are home to natural beauty in their constant shifting nature, their attractive lures of both sight and treasure, as well as their thorns of danger and ferocity. The changing nature of Thassa & Sune’s influence on the islands maintain an opacity of mysticism, making them nigh impossible to keep an accurate chart or map of. Thus, even the most famed locations appear on no map, and sailors or explorers might spot them when or wherever Thassa-Istishia wills. Legends tell Erastés, of a hidden city that is found and resided by those whose hearts yearn for nothing but wanderlust.

### Sune In Sorrow

For something to be truly beautiful, it must never stay the same. Because when love stagnates, it becomes transparent. That is all it will ever be. Beauty is fleeting, moment to moment, and the land should be as well.

Embarking on a journey through Naxos and Natras is an expedition into the unknown, a venture through coastal mountains that defy conventional understanding. As travelers ascend the rugged paths, a mystic veil shrouds the landscape, making every step a venture into uncertainty.

**1. Shifting Scenery:** Naxos and Natras are known for their ever-changing landscapes. Mountains appear differently each time one gazes upon them, as if the very essence of the range is fluid. Rock formations morph into fantastical shapes, and the play of light creates illusions that challenge the perception of reality.

**2. Whispering Winds:** The winds that weave through the craggy peaks seem to carry whispers of forgotten tales. It is said that these winds hold the memories of ancient travelers and that attuning one's senses to their ethereal murmurings may reveal glimpses of the mountains' secrets.

**3. Illusory Paths:** Navigating the mountain trails proves challenging, for the paths are ever-shifting illusions. What appears as a well-trodden trail might lead to an abrupt cliff or converge into a mysterious mist. Maps become unreliable guides, and only those attuned to the subtle energies of the mountains can discern the true routes.

**4. Enchanted Flora:** Flora in Naxos and Natras possesses an otherworldly allure. Luminescent moss carpets the ground, casting an eerie glow during the night. Exotic flowers with petals that change color based on the emotions of those nearby bloom along the paths, creating a living canvas of emotions.

**5. Ethereal Wildlife:** Strange and magical creatures call Naxos and Natras home. Ethereal songbirds with feathers that refract light in dazzling patterns fill the air with haunting melodies. Ghostly apparitions of wildlife from ages past occasionally make fleeting appearances, adding to the surreal atmosphere.

**6. Wisps of Mysticism:** Ethereal wisps, known as the Heartwhispers, drift through the mountain air. These wisps are said to be conduits of ancient magic, guiding or misleading travelers based on their intentions. Following the Veilwhispers may lead to hidden sanctuaries or unveil glimpses of Naxos and Natras's past.

**7. Temporal Pockets:** Within Naxos and Natras, time seems to behave erratically. Travelers may experience moments of déjà vu or witness scenes from the past or future. These temporal pockets challenge the very concept of a linear journey, leaving adventurers uncertain about when they truly are.

**8. The Nexus Summit:** At the heart of Naxos and Natras lies the Nexus Summit, an ethereal plateau where the boundaries between dimensions blur. It is rumored that the veiled nature of the mountains stems from an ancient arcane nexus located here, shrouded in an aura of untapped potential.

Embarking on a journey through Naxos and Natras is not merely a physical exploration but a venture into the mystical unknown. The shifting nature of the mountains challenges the mind and spirit, offering a unique experience that few dare to undertake.
