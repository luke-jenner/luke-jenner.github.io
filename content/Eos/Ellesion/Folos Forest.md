[[Ellesion]]

Spreading for hundreds of miles across northern Ellesion, the Folos Forest is one of Eos’ oldest oak forests. Mythology has it that it was populated by centaurs and fairies, and is named after the centaur’s king, Folos, who hosted ancient Altrinioan heroes as they were facing their coming-of-age rites. Traversed by the Erymanthos and Ladon Rivers, the forest runs rich with ethereal springs
