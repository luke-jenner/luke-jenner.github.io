[[Ellesion]], backs up to the [[Ouránios Rise]]

Rebuilt after its destruction in the Godswar, Néo Fanári is the heir of the mythical city of Fanári, once the shining beacon of the Skliathos. It is known to the Altrinioans as the farthest reaches of the [[Altrinios]] coalition, though of all the populations in that coalition, it is the one that has the least feeling of belonging to the city-state - either by distance to [[Altrinios]] or by its own history and culture, or by the simple power of the city itself. The city has inherited all the myths and traditions of its predecessor, proud of its past, but promising not to make mistakes of the powerful city-states. The city has created immediate separation of politic and religion, removing all affinity for gods from their citadels. Not indicating neglect towards the gods, the religiosity of the inhabitants is palpable in most houses in the city. Once run by an archpriest of the elven god Correlon, the Arch Heart, the city is now governed by the [[Triarchy]] - a confluence of leaders from the city’s navy, the city’s engineers, and the city’s artisans. 

While separate in politics from their origins of Corellon, Néo Fanári still has many elves that did not retreat into the Folos Forest, as well as many that immigrated back to Ellesion after The Retreat from Ethelia across the Starfallen Sea. Many of these elves uphold high values of art, music, and craft, while many have set engineering sights on beauty in advancement of technology - over the last 50 years or more, the city has begun building upwards through infrastructural brunestone, becoming a semi-floating city. 
### Neighborhoods 
**Skylos Heights** - Up-and-coming, thriving hub of arts. Former home of Trianta & Janus.

**Naval District** - Central, downtown sector. Contains the Skilaic Gate. Home to Istoria, the Cobalt Reserve, as well as several temples to Corellon & Pelor.

**Apostoli Valley** - Once home to many industrial shops in their mining age, now shifting and seeing influx of young artist residents as industry changes.

**Camos Dale** - Cresting valley of one of the city’s hills, once built to be residential and now become a hub of entertainment sporting street vendors, mall spaces, and music venues.

**The Glowshore** - On the city’s eastern edge, home to some of the city’s longest running art galleries & patrons, has since become a gorgeous strip of murals, public and street arts.**
### Enkardios 
**

Between Apostoli Valley & Skylos Heights

A very indoor-outdoor space, three levels, four in some towers, with a very green patio that is cantilevered to extend out over the cliffs edge. Entirely lit by arcane lamps, some panels on the outside that flit thin, ribbon like lights across them making out shifting designs themed for the holiday, occasionally forming and freezing in the shape of the the tavern’s name and branding

If asking about The Sounding Fury 

-They’re treasure hunters and questers - they make it sound like a noble pursuit, like they’re doing it for the greater good, but if you ask me, they’re banking in on it all

-They’ve rivals now, The Pathos Assembly is recruiting and trading - secrets for secrets, rumors for rumors, powers for powers

### City Rumors

**- Sereno isn’t much of an issue, just take precautions if you travel - some concern if all the travelers coming in have brought it with them
- Army of Azuth is sending arcanists to Velde Aerdrie, forming an allegiance against the threat of Thay. Many think war is imminent, hoping it stays far to the north
- Stories of fires have been rampant and common in the city recently - the Dousing Division has been hard at work, won’t be surprised if more pop up during the festival
- No one has actually seen fires, but have heard of burn victims and seen the burnt remains of them
- Each time a fire starts, the zone is warded by the Dousing Division - a platoon of arcanists that safeguard the city

### Encounter Table

1-2 - Satyr bards promoting concert by the one and only [Jauvir](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saFVrGPjlGupP-TkIXCo9D_8worHiciEwODQYZ0QUdg/edit) - dances that are life changing and awakening 

3-4 - Clattering of pots & pans, sheet metals wavering, and some thauamtrugical magicks to create the sounds of a storm pass by as a parade of athletic looking elves, tieflings, and dragonborn pass by - two brandishing banners with four lightning bolts radiating from the center of the shield - worshippers of Kord, the Storm Lord (Talos in Willow) - asking for storms to come sew the seeds of the new year 

5-6 - Small tent, ~5 feet in diameter - a drow woman sitting in front of a crystal ball, telling fortunes of the new year 

7-8 - Farmers Market, displaying crops to look forward to for the year including an agricultural contest 

Blue-Ribbon Mandrake Roots, Thorn-Elemental pulling a cart full of Sunberry Bushes, a mountain-elf showing off Coldwood Blades - a fey-variety of hickory that reaches maturity in 2 decades and has properties identical to steel

9-10 - Priests of Pelor, The Dawnfather, handing out Sunflowers of Pelor 

Arcana, Medicine, or Nature - plants typically found where undead were destroyed - petals can be treated with oils/solvents and be consumed to bolster spells related to creation of light, doubling spell areas 

11 - Eladrin teaching and trading for Serren Wood - wood from trees of Arborea’s top layer in Arvandor that are vessels for nature spirits (bows, arrows, etc made from thai wood adds 1d4+1 radiant damage)

12-13 - An older leonin sharing teas made from various roots, then selling roots

Angelica Root - plant grows to a hight of 8 feet, cluster of white or pink flowers at top of stem - relieves coughs

Base Mulhein - flower stalks are clear yellow, ~e feet at top of stalk, leaves of herb can reduce damage taken by burns 

Bishop’s Weed - small, pale blue flowers and pale green leaves - said to protect people from plague (+5 to Con Saves against Disease), often drunk in wine

Bloodkeep - Tall stalks with jagged leaves and purple-red flowers - fresh leaves can be bound to a wound to stop bleed at once and quicken coagulation (within 2 rounds of injury, character regains 20% of lost hitpoints)

Calithil - a dwarven delight, vines with waxy leaves that grow in small clumps - small white flowers grow, which turn into light blue berries - dwarves send their children to pick the berries to harvest into wine & jams - drinking the wine often gives feelings of invincibility (Heroism)

Ember Root - not named after Emberhold, though a commonplace drink there - shriveled coconut looking plant native to the elemental plane of fire that grows on solid stone in areas of extremely sunny or hot conditions - flesh of the plant is poisonous, but core contains drinking liquid that never grows hotter than 50 degrees and one ounce of which equates to a day’s worth of water

Green-Air Bramble - fast-growing vines with green berries, can grow in inhospitable climates, though exposure to poison quickly kills plant - carrying vine or ingesting tea grants +2 to Con Saves against inhaled poisons or airborne diseases (stiniking cloud) 

Halcyon Crocus - In highland meadows grow this pale white-silver crocus - by starlight, the nectar can be harvested from its simple bloom and dried into snuff or jam that engulfs the user in bittersweet recollections. With each dose, user remembers spell forgotten, effectively allowing them to recast it without expending a spell slot - however, can inflict 2d8 psychic damage 

Hawkleaf - Oval leaves, covers dwith small hairs on the undreside - increases character eyesight for 1d4 hours - +3 on perception checks involving sight, ballistic ranges are treated as if 20 feet or less 

14 - Flock of colorful birds are delivering messages throughout the city - a common practice in Neo Fanari that is slowly being replaced with magical birds that achieve the same result (Paper Birds, but in gadget form - ClockworkBird)

15 - Blink Squirrels - blinking in and out of stalls stealing food, one will blink and try to steal from player with visible bag or object out - locals just shrug them off - some have magical wards against minor blinking 

16 - In a neighborhood square, a group of treants have arrived for the festival and have planted themselves around a fountain - children are flocking around them, some climbing the treants playfully, though many adults are peeving because the treants brought with them flocks of pixies that are going around playing pranks on people

17 - A minor parade of the Epistimi Omada - translated to the League of Engineers - moves through the city both visiting crafters and putting on a display. The dozen carts and carriages are quite protected by a menagerie of armed militia, albeit their guards laxed and amicable for the festival theme 

-Otto immediately clocks several ethereal rifles, modeled after the Maragon makes 

-The carriages are gaudy and, while horse-pulled, appear to levitate in places 

-Several banners/standards can be seen, showing insignia of different Councilors of the Triarchy that show allegiance to the Epistimi Omada (recognize one from Morreus’ coat)

-Unmistakable, moving with the small parade, are several automatons - some carrying standards, others simply dressed and walking with the parade

18 - A minor parade of Corellon, the Arch Heart - elves and eladrin, bardic in their marching musical performances - inviting passerby to momentarily take part in dance - any that do so gain 2d10 temporary hitpoints and 1d8 bardic inspiration

### Néo Fanári Factions

Home of a chapter [[The Sounding Fury]]
#### Episti Omada  - League of Engineers

Magewrights throught the pipeline of ethereal refinement - from mining to refining to inventing to crafting to infusing to enchanting 


-Sira, Githyanki Alchemist - she is hiding from the Astral Sea but toying with knowledge of its permeability 

-Evenus (blue tiefling) & Aithra (female elf) - golemsmiths/anvilwrights 
	-Learned mostly from dwarves in Votan & innovations from their forges
	-implementing Synasthium to become the heart-core of anvilwrights - capable of harnessing and expressing emotions
	 shelves and shelves of parts, brass gears, scraps of leather and folded hides. Aside from the obvious cooking and sleeping areas, you also see a few tables with parts scattered about. On the nearest table, a human-sized mechanical man is leaned over a hunk of blood-red crystal about the size of a loaf of bread. He looks up at you, curiously, and he’s holding a couple of tools. You notice, too, that though he’s human sized, he’s got a smaller head than you’d expect, and rather than having a full form he’s kind of skeletal. You can see his pistons and gears very clearly, with his red glowing crystal mounted in his chest, and below that what looks like some sort of reciprocating steam engine moving pistons up and down. Little pipes vent steam out of random places on his torso.
	“Counter, we have guests! Can you boil up some tea?” The mechanical man’s eyes glow for a moment and he excitedly walks to the kitchen.
