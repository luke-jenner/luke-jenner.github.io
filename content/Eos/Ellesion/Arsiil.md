In between the Ouránios Peaks and the Sea of Skilathos lies Arsiil, an expanse of agriculture & prosperity. City-state theocracy - run by Veradron, an angel of The Dawnfather that delivered the city from catastrophe fifty years ago. Out of protection of the city’s agricultural boons, Veradron has turned the city rather isolationist over the last 30 years. 

Flourishing gardens, vibrant arts life, thirst for knowledge. Many independent schools are free to teach broad curricula that beget a well-read populace. Although the long list of censored works constrains opportunities for higher education, especially in philosophy & literature, the cist-state cautiously embraces progress, adopting developments in magic and science as long as they don’t contradict religious principles. 

### Brilliant Night

For about one week every three years, a mysterious lunar phenomenon bathes Arsiil with light in the dead of night. Ancient magic causes the moon to blaze like the sun for a short while. Arsiilians call this phenomenon “Brilliant Night” and celebrate it with a multi day festival commemorating light’s triumphs over darkness. Veradron suspends the city-state’s nightly curfew in honor of the holiday. This year, celebrations are muted. 

Recently, anarchists called the Ashen Heirs have tormented the city with propaganda and violence, seeking to incite rebellion. The Brightguard struggles to maintain law amid the havoc. Stretched thin, the order detains suspected resistances members and issues citations. This makes hiding in plain sight difficult for members of a more peaceable resistance group, The Silent Roar, that hopes to restore Arsiil to its former glory. 

### Brightguard

Before Veradron, the Brightguard was a fringe collective of devout protectors who vowed to defend Arsiil from evil in the name of The Dawnfather. When the angel deemed service in the Brightguard a holy calling, the group’s ranks swelled. Most members have unshakeable resolve, but recently revolutionary acts have the order on edge. The Brightbuard obeys Veradron and, through him, The Dawnfather.

### The Silent Roar

Members of the Roar seek to return Veradron to The Dawnfather’s domain and restore Arsiil to a state of self-rule. Named for the lions that roam beyond the city, the faction is secretly led by famed actor Samwell Regis, and its agents are largely chaotic good artisans, philosophers, and merchants who have suffered under Veradron’s isolationist policies. Silent Roar agents are usually patient and nonviolent, but they defend the order and its members like lions protect their prides. They resent other revolutionary groups whos violent ways cause the people to distrust the Silent Roar by extension. Many members romanticize Arsiil’s past even as they acknowledge the city-state has faced dire problems and might not have survived without Veradron’s intervention. 

### Three Sun Square

Avalin Sahar - decorative turquoise-and-gold facade of the city-state’s oldest temple, Avalin Sahar, beckons all to kneel in worship of The Dawnfather
Noble Jewel - Royal Palace, headquarters of the Brightguard. Occasionally Veradron appears to issue a proclamation. 
Coral Bazaar - Fragrant spices lure shoppers to the bustling Bazaar, a sprawling complex of vendors that hides an underground market.
Foothills of the Ouránios Peaks - Fertile, blessing farmers with bountiful harvests of juicy pomegranates, buttery pistachios, and crimson strands of saffron. Rebellion also flourishes, as the Brightguard has a smaller presence here, and the nation’s curfew is not enforced. Free thinkers gather at aged treehouses, discussing philosophy as they sip from steaming cups and act as secret missionaries who dare to defy angelic law.
The Sky Prison - A floating edifice hanging over a lake of shattered glass - crystalline hive peppered with demiplanes of divine judgement. Inside lurk potent evils banished by Veradron, such as an adult blue dracolich and a beholder. Given Veradron’s  intolerance for misconduct, the prison’s population continues to grow, but now it fills with more ordinary folk.**
