### Kothar's Description

Bit of a melting pot, that one. Interconnected floating black marble islands with magical bridges - lot of traders seeking better or less conspicuous deals than you’ll find on the surface. Less military, more likely to come into contact with pirates. Powerful arcane dealers currently have a hold on the place - tend to be a bit more corrupt. A lot of strong wards on the market - you’ll lose limbs for stealing. 

Large, central island - potentially 4 miles wide - cut from black rock with white veins as if it was a piece from the northern mines of the Haunted Highlands in Kawluurac - nearly a dozen radiating, orbiting smaller motes and some even smaller satellites - all connected by various arcane tethers, bridges, gondolas, and more - nearly every visible surface has construction & paved streets.

Bustling skyports like you’ve never seen outside of [[Altrinios]] or Velde Aerdrie, construction is far from uniform - some dwarven structures on the central mote, many gnomish styled buildings with their precarious, twisting and leaning nature - tall and narrow buildings stand up as towers amidst wider spanning blocks of market space.

Market sprawls across series of interconnected indoor-outdoor bazaars, each adorned with richly colored tents, stalls inhabited by occupant merchants or meetings, and food & drink vendors galore. 

A cacophony of voices fills the air, echoing the various tongues of races and creatures from all across Eos. Exotic scents waft through the lanes - spicy foreign cuisines, rare herbs, smoldering incenses… Mesmerizing displays of ambient magic and shimmering lights move throughout the space. 

High above, on the central mote, is perched a large tower - obviously arcane in nature with its rotating levels, as if the Space Needle in Seattle had far more discs and other smaller towers in its orbit. 

“The Obelisk,” Kothar indicates. “For near 10 years, a guild of powerful mages that don’t leave the Nexus. They keep watch and preserve order here, or at least integrity. They’ve placed countless wards on the markets - steal something, you lose a limb. Great for people seeking a neutral ground. Bad for people clumsy and prone to violence. Would never call them corrupt, though there’s a certain lack of discretion in their wards that you can’t exactly reason with.”

Then, flying off of one of the discs, two dragons in the sky. Strikingly different though both sizable of adult dragons, one gleaming with bronze scales, the other a solid, deep blue. Roars are heard between the two, exchanging some sort of good bye in draconic - on whatever note - as the blue dragon rise higher into the skies, past the clouds, and the bronze dragon strafes the Obelisk before descending into the markets.

“Certainly gives visitors here a sense of perspective. Dragons also come here to exchange news, goods, and more. They also often negotiate transactions with their deep, resonating voices. They can assess the authenticity of magical items with a single glance. They’re arbiters in disputes. Generally held in high regard by all, whether or not you want to.”

Pirate factions, flying their skull-adorned banners, occupy their own quarters of hte market. Their stalls are piled high with relics plundered from across the realms. Buccaneers trade stories of their exploits, while skilled navigators offer charts to the skies.

In the center of the bazaar, a grand stage hosting a dazzling array of performers. Fire-breathers, illusionists, and aerial acrobats captivate crowds. Bards strum their magical instruments, appeasing passerby with tales.

Luxurious rooms, featherbeds, ambrosial nectars, celestial wines. “In the light’s embrace… All shadows flee.” “As the sun rises… So does hope.” “In radiance.”
	Calming and glowing bioluminescent garden, cascading gradient that reflects the setting sun - enormous crystal-like flowers with butterflies whose wings reflect, if not absorb, those colors. <br> 
	A gentle, ever-present breeze carries with it a soothing melody - no visible musician, though its melodies gently dance around you. <br> 
	Scattered throughout the garden are elegant pavilions, each one designed for group sitting - adorned with celestial tapestries depicting stories of creation and harmony - provide sweeping views of the entire Nexus skyline, as well as the far lands below.

#### Sune House
Rahela
Smells guide you to it - a short but wide building on the central island maybe a mile from The Obelisk - made of white marble and decorated with gold leaf. Entrance is flanked by two statues of the goddess, Sune - one representing her beauty, depicting her in a brilliantly carved silk gown that somehow has been sculpted to look semi-translucent on her human form, and the other representing her Grace - her fire-hair flowing excitingly as her marble form appears to gesture to a real garden beneath her. 

Inside the spa, the atmosphere is calm and serene - the air is filled with floral incenses, walls are lined with mirrors that reflect the sunlight streaming through dancing stained glass windows. 

A large central common pool is accessible past the entryway where two Sunites stand - around which are two spiral staircases leading up to a rooftop terrace with beds and the like. There are hallways with ambulatory rooms around the space for private bathing and pampering. 

-Offer number of treatments, including massages, body wraps, facials, along with pools and baths. 
-Special baths, including rose petals to promote love and romance, lavender to soothe the body and mind

“Beauty is more than skin-deep - it issues from the core of oneself and shows their fair face to the world.”

“May Sune’s love heal your wounds.”
“May Sune’s joy replace your sorrow.”

### The Society of Valor - The Skyborne Stage

Relatively large structure, being on its own floating mote that orbits the Nexus - several smaller floating motes have been enchanted to rise back and forth between the main island’s streets and the Skyborne Stage, serving as a lift ride for attendees and more. Arena itself is made of polished marble and some gleaming metals, surrounded by high, rounded walls. 

The entrance - a thoroughfare plaza with many groups meeting up before paying their entry - is dotted with small individual vendors for food, drink, and even enchanted pennants for particular battles if not just for the Society of Valor and their reverence to Kord. The arena gate is guarded by two massive statues of Kord himself - one with a hammer raised high, the other holding a sword in the opposite hand. The statues, nearly 18 feet tall, are carved from the same black marble as the central island of the Nexus.

Calling around are bookies, walking with what look like armed guards of Kord, carrying their own coin satchels and scrolls that update with current standings.
