[[Ellesion]]
Serves at the default capital for [[Hetos-Run]], a meeting place for the Prides and Peoples, and the home of the primal leaders. Stone buildings and slender windmills jut above the plains, their pale colors and metal decorations shimmering in the light and changing color as the sun moves across the sky. Many leonin matriarchs and otherwise souls retire to Apérantos to share their wisdom with all prides. In recent decades, many non-leonin traders have been admitted to Apérantos, provoking exaggerated tales of the leonin sages and their golden city. 

In the century or more of the Third Age, many smaller settlements have begun developing atop ruins of old - ancient grounds whose design plan resembles primal beings and spirits, each exhibiting attention to astronomical phenomena. The peoples of these settlements, however, stay nomadic, composed of wayfarers from all corners of Eos that seek life outside of condensed urbanization.

### Description

As you enter Aperantos, you're greeted by the sight of towering earthen walls adorned with intricate carvings and motifs, depicting scenes from ancient myths and tales of heroism. These walls, baked by the relentless sun, form a protective barrier around the city, creating a sense of security and belonging for its inhabitants. The city itself is dappled with pale colors and metal decorations that shimmer in the light, changing color as the su moves across the sky.

The mud-brick and stone structures within the city vary in size and shape, reflecting the diverse architectural styles of the different peoples and cultures that call Aperantos home. Some buildings rise high into the sky, adorned with colorful banners and elaborate domes, while others squat close to the ground, their cool interiors providing respite from the heat of the day.

Wide streets wind their way through the city, flanked by rows of squat houses and bustling market stalls. Here, you'll find artisans at work, crafting intricate jewelry and weaving vibrant tapestries, their skilled hands bringing to life the rich tapestry of Aperantos' culture.

At the center of the city, rising proudly above the rooftops, stands the grand Amphitheater. Its terraced seating cascades down into the earth like the petals of a giant flower, providing a gathering place for the citizens of Aperantos to come together and celebrate their shared heritage.

As the sun sets, bathing the city in a warm golden light, the bustling streets of Aperantos come alive with activity. Children play in the dusty squares, while elders gather in the shade of ancient trees to swap stories and share wisdom.
