(Luh-th)
[[Ellesion]], hidden in [[Folos Forest]]
Surrounded by the wonders and mysteries of the Folos Forest, Lœth is an ancient elven city that dates back to the First Age. In many histories of the city-states of Ellesion, Lœth has been forgotten and left out as the Lœthian people have remained secluded. Now, in the Third Age, the magicks of the city are discovered by adventurers and its stories are told through bardic song.

*Arriving on the other side of the teleportation disk, you arrive at a small shrine on a hill, immediately struck by the village below you. Nestled in a lush river valley, you see a small constructed town that feels ancient, untouched, and almost dreamlike. Tall, narrow, elven-gothic stone structures rise in sharp verticals. The buildings, crafted from light gray stone veined with silver, are covered in creeping ivy and adorned with intricate elven carvings that seem to tell long-forgotten stories of the gods. Tall, slender archways, high-vaulted roofs, and bridges made of stone stretch between structures at various heights, connecting the village in an almost web-liek pattern.

The village itself is vertically stacked into the valley's walls, with narrow streets winding upward like spirals, and buildings clinging to the cliffs. Moss, vines, and hanging plants spill over the stone, giving the impression that nature has slowly woven itself into the architecture. The village is bathed in a soft, pale glow from bioluminescent plants that light the dark undergrwoth and adorn many of the buildings.

The village feels incredibly still and quiet; the only sounds are the rushing of the river and distant calls of birds. A faint mist clings to the ground, weaving through the trees and covering the ground in a foggy shroud. The air smells of damp earth, pine. 

(downriver lies Lake Vlentios, its waters dark and still...)

- Most buildings are entirely closed from the outside while sunlight is touching the valley

**Moonlight Tattoos**

	- The lost deity was sundered into light and dark
	- According to secret myths, Ultima Thule was reincarnated as Kruphix, the daughter of light and darkness - the Horizon
